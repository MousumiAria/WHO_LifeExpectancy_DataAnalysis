Project Name:WHO_LifeExpectancy_DataAnalysis

Potential insights and visualizations are:

1. Trends and Disparities in Life Expectancy:

i)Data Load and Preparation:
First, ensure you have loaded the dataset into Power BI.
Check the data types of your columns. Ensure the 'Year' column is recognized as a date or a whole number, and 'Life Expectancy' is a number.

ii). Overall Life Expectancy Trend:
Insert a line chart into your report.
Drag the 'Year' column into the axis area and 'Life Expectancy' into the values area. This will show you the global trend of life expectancy over time.

iii). Country-wise Trend:
Use another line chart or a combo chart.
For the axis, use 'Year', and for values use 'Life Expectancy'. Also, drag the 'Country' field into the legend or color area. This will give you a line for each country, allowing you to see disparities and trends at the same time.

iv) Comparing Developed vs. Developing:
Use a line or column chart to represent the data.
Add 'Year' to the axis and 'Life Expectancy' to values.
Use 'Status' (Developed/Developing) in the legend or color area.
This will allow you to see how developed countries' life expectancy trends compare to those of developing countries.

v). Country with Highest & Lowest Life Expectancy:
For a specific year or range, you might want to identify countries with the highest and lowest life expectancy.
Use a card or a KPI visual for highest and lowest values.
Or use a bar or column chart sorted by 'Life Expectancy' to see the countries ranked by their life expectancy.

vi).Interactive Filtering:
Introduce slicers to your dashboard, which allow users to select specific years or countries. This will enable users to focus on specific time frames or countries of interest.
Incorporate a map visual and use 'Life Expectancy' as a measure. This provides a geographical representation of life expectancy data, where users can identify regions with higher or lower life expectancy.

vii). Insights:
Using the visuals, derive insights such as:
Countries that have seen a significant increase or decrease in life expectancy over time.
The gap between the highest and lowest life expectancy and how it's changing.
How external events, like wars or economic downturns, might have impacted life expectancy in certain regions.


2. Relationship between Economic and Health Indicators:

Analyzing the relationship between economic and health indicators is essential to understand how a country's economic status can influence the health and well-being of its population.
